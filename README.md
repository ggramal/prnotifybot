![tg](img/tg.png)

## How it works
* Sends a message in format

`[<CLOSED|OPEN|MERGED>] <PR title> <PR url>` - message header

* if the status of the PR has changed eg its closed,opened,merged. prnotifybot will edit the notification message and reflect those changes in its header
* if some one pushed code to the source branch of the PR. Notification message for this PR will be edited and new line will be added

`<timestamp> <user> pushed`

* if someone created/edited/deleted a comment or issue comment. Notification message for this PR will be edited with a new line

`<timestamp> <user> <created|deleted|edited> [comment](<link_to_comment>)`

* if someone approved the PR Notification message for this PR will be edited with a new line

`<timestamp> <user> approved :heavy_check_mark:`



## Issues
Currently prnotifybot stores message ids and thier corresponding messages in memory.
So after restart of the app new pr notification messages will be sent if one of the events described in [How it works](#how-it-works) occur
